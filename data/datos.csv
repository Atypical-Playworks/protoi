It helps people understand laws, analyze documents, and receive safe, reliable legal guidance using text, voice, images, and live video.

Digital literacy remains a major challenge across Africa—many citizens struggle with navigating apps, reading long documents, or understanding legal terms. AfriLex solves this by communicating in people’s own languages, accents, cultures, and expressions, making legal understanding feel natural and familiar rather than technical or intimidating.

Legal help is also extremely expensive across the continent. Most people cannot afford a lawyer or even a brief consultation. AfriLex fills this critical gap by offering instant, low-cost legal information, helping users understand contracts, fines, rental issues, police encounters, workplace disputes, and more.

Users can simply show a document to the camera, speak in their mother tongue, or interact face-to-face, and AfriLex explains everything clearly. With support for 12+ African languages, the assistant becomes accessible to millions who are often left out of digital and legal systems.

In an era where attention is the new currency, AURA serves as your digital mint, transforming raw, fleeting ideas into polished, high-value content assets.

We built AURA because we understand the struggle of ""Blank Canvas Paralysis."" You have the charisma, the camera gear, and the audience, but sometimes the idea just won't take shape. Or perhaps you have the concept, but you're stuck on how to package it for the algorithm.

AURA is not just a utility; it is a creative partner. It combines the raw computational power of Google's Gemini AI with a sophisticated, user-centric design philosophy we call ""Gilded Noir."" The result is a platform that feels less like software and more like a luxury studio suite—a place where your creativity is treated with the dignity it deserves.

AURA handles the heavy lifting of pre-production, allowing you to focus on what you do best: performing and connecting with your audience.

The first 3 seconds of your video determine its destiny. AURA generates 5 distinct viral hook options for every query. These aren't just random titles; they are psychologically calibrated scroll-stoppers designed to trigger curiosity, debate, or emotion.

A good hook is wasted on a bad video. AURA writes a complete 60-second script tailored specifically to the pacing of short-form content.

Before they click, they must see. AURA leverages the gemini-2.5-flash-image model to generate 4 high-fidelity thumbnail concepts. These serve as artistic storyboards, giving you concrete visual references for lighting, composition, and expression before you even pick up a camera.

8,Verified Hands: The Multimodal AI Proctor,An AI verification system that audits performance and grades trade skills with strict security checks.,,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 12, 2025","I built Verified Hands. It’s a real-time AI certification platform that solves this by turning your laptop or phone into a strict exam center.

The idea is simple: You don't just take a test; you demonstrate your skill live on camera. I used Google Gemini 3 Pro to create an AI ""Drill Sergeant"" that actually watches you work, guides you through tasks, and grades you instantly. It’s not just recording video—it’s understanding what you’re doing.                                                How It Works

Identity First: You can't just log in. You have to capture a live ""Master Key"" photo. The system then checks your face every few seconds during the exam to make sure you haven't swapped places with someone else.

The 360° Object Hunter: Before you start, the AI makes you scan your room with your camera. It hunts for phones, second monitors, or people hiding in the corner. If the room isn't clean, the exam doesn't start.

The Drill Sergeant: This is the cool part. If you're doing a physical task (like soldering) or a digital one (like coding), the AI watches you. If you hold a tool wrong or forget your safety goggles, it shouts at you (literally, using text-to-speech) to fix it. It forces you to do it right.

Stealth Security: While you work, a background ""Interceptor"" is analyzing everything. It tracks your eye movement to see if you're looking at notes, and even monitors your jaw movement to catch you whispering to a friend.

The Result: If you pass, you get a Verified Career Passport. It’s a digital certificate with a hash of your session and a detailed breakdown of your skills. It’s proof that you actually did the work.

Key Features

Powered by Gemini 3 Pro: I used the new ""Deep Think"" capabilities so the AI can reason through complex physical tasks, not just guess.

Diagnostic error affects 12 million Americans annually [1]. In women's health, this crisis is acute: women are diagnosed on average 4 years later than men [2]. This gap highlights the role of cognitive phenomena such as Diagnostic Shadowing [3], a bias where physical symptoms are misattributed to psychiatric history.

However, this is rarely negligence. It is a failure of Dual Process Theory under pressure. High cognitive load forces physicians to rely on System 1 (fast/heuristic thinking), bypassing System 2 (slow/analytical thinking). Harmless shortcuts then mutate into dangerous biases [4].

The Solution: A Cognitive Forcing Strategy

We introduce CLARA: Clinical Logic Assessment & Reasoning Auditor, a multimodal AI agent powered by Gemini 3 Pro. CLARA acts as a Cognitive Forcing Strategy - an ""External System 2"" that supports physicians when their own cognitive bandwidth is exhausted.

Unlike a scribe recording what is said, CLARA audits the logic of the encounter. Designed as a safety net, she runs in the background to flag high-risk logic patterns for review prior to discharge.

Methodology & Impact

Engineered with the Google AI Studio, CLARA processes consented consultation audio to generate standardized ""Audit Flags"" (JSON). This transforms the subjective experience of ""being dismissed"" into objective data, protecting patients from gender-based bias while shielding doctors from the inevitability of human fatigue.

Engines like Stockfish deliver flawless calculations but no guidance--reducing positions to cold numbers (eg ""+1.5"") without teaching the why or How behind them.

Modern foundation models, by contrast, have incredible multimodal capabilities and can explain concepts, in chess they frequently hallucinate, even producing illegal moves or blundering at amateur level Source-1, a shortcoming also confirmed by Demis Hassabis in recent Game Arena evaluations : ""perform… not very well atm"" Source-2 and ""…Note that none of these AI models are good at chess yet…"" Source-3

ChessOdyssey reinvents this paradigm as a Cognitive Gym, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Engine fusing Gemini 3 Pro’s visual reasoning with algorithmic game theory to democratize Grandmaster-level intuition and mastery for all, from children to aspiring pros.

Pure LLMs struggle with chess calculation (often hallucinating illegal moves), while pure engines lack semantic reasoning and multimodal capabilities. ChessOdyssey fuses them:

1. The Neuro Layer (Gemini 3 Pro): Acts as the Visionary Mentor. It uses Multimodal Vision to ""see"" the board, identify structures, and explain concepts via Socratic dialogue (""Caissa’s Shadow""). Integrating Google Search (""Historical Echo""), it grounds advice in history, while linking the player’s current position to iconic games, reminding them that the challenges they face are the very ones that shaped the legends.

2. The Symbolic Layer (""Mini-Stockfish""): Acts as the Truth Filter.

Ace Analyzer isn't another feel‑good app. It's built for the real frustrations students actually face—the ones nobody talks about in polished marketing materials.

You're sitting with a textbook, completely lost. Not just confused about one line, but lost in the way that makes you question whether you're smart enough to understand this at all. The explanations in your book sound like they're written in a different language. Your teacher moved on four topics ago. Google gives you either oversimplified summaries or PhD-level papers with no middle ground.

Chat Mode is that moment when you need someone who doesn't judge, doesn't assume you're stupid for asking, and breaks down concepts the way they should have been explained in the first place. Clear language. Step-by-step. No fluff. Just the core idea explained until it actually lands.

#### Exam Mode (Answer Analyzer): The Moment After the Test
The test is over. You're sitting in the hallway with your friend, both of you confused about how much you lost. You write out your answer hoping someone will read it and tell you exactly where the examiners thought you went wrong—but that feedback never comes. Teachers hand back marks, maybe a circled number, but not a real explanation of the gap between what you wrote and what would have scored higher.

Exam Mode fills that void. Upload a photo of your answer sheet or paste your written response. Ace Analyzer doesn't just mark it wrong—it shows you the structure an excellent answer would have had, the points you missed, and the conceptual gaps hiding in your response. It's like having a ruthless senior who actually cares enough to explain where your thinking broke down and how to think differently next time.

I built StructViz AI because I was that student. Using Gemini 3 Pro, I created 14 interactive visualizations that actually show you what's happening when algorithms run—not just static diagrams, but real animations you can control.

What's Inside: Everything from the basics (stacks, queues, hash tables) to interview essentials (AVL trees, tries, dynamic programming) to the really cool stuff (pathfinding algorithms racing each other, geometric convex hulls). Each one lets you step through operations frame-by-frame, speed things up or slow them down, and see exactly why an algorithm makes each decision.

The Gemini Magic: Here's where it gets interesting. Sketch a tree on paper, upload it, and watch Gemini turn it into a working visualization. Say ""generate a maze and solve it with A-star"" out loud—it just works. Ask ""why did the algorithm choose this path?""—Gemini explains while highlighting the exact nodes it's talking about. This wasn't possible before Gemini 3's reasoning capabilities.

Why It Matters: Most CS students struggle to visualize algorithms—I know I did. StructViz connects theory to practice by showing how these structures power GPS navigation, autocomplete, database indexing, and everything else we use daily. It's the tool I wish existed when I was learning this stuff.

By leveraging Google Gemini 3 Pro's Deep Think reasoning and pixel-precise spatial analysis, we've built the world's first legally-admissible AI accident reconstructor that transforms raw dashcam footage into comprehensive forensic reports in under 60 seconds.

The Impact: With 40+ million auto claims filed annually in the US alone and average settlement times exceeding 30 days, CrashLens addresses a $45 billion operational inefficiency. Our solution doesn't just detect collisions—it determines liability with court-ready evidence and transparent reasoning.

The Problem: Insurance's ""Black Box"" Crisis
Current State of Claims Processing
The insurance industry faces a critical paradox:

Data abundance: 63% of US drivers now use dashcams, generating millions of hours of collision footage annually

Processing paralysis: Human adjusters can't efficiently review this video evidence at scale

Legal liability: Existing ""Silent Adjuster"" AI systems that automate payouts face lawsuits for being opaque ""black boxes"" that can't explain their decisions under the Daubert standard for evidence admissibility

Real-World Example: State Farm's automated claims system was challenged in court when it couldn't explain why it recommended a lower payout for similar accidents in specific zip codes. The lack of transparent reasoning cost the company millions in bad faith claims.

Why Traditional Computer Vision Fails
Standard CV approaches can detect that a crash occurred (via motion/sound spikes) but cannot:

Determine why it happened (causal reasoning)

It sits at the intersection of program analysis, developer tooling, and containerized execution: a Web Dashboard (Control Plane) orchestrates a Python‑based AI Agent to statically analyze repositories and produce a structured JSON ""CLI Manifest."" A local Nexus CLI (Execution Plane), implemented as a single Go binary, syncs manifests, JIT‑generates language‑specific Bridge scripts, and runs repository functions inside ephemeral Docker containers — preserving the original runtime environment while removing plumbing like argument parsing, serialization, and glue code.

This document provides a detailed technical walkthrough of Nexus's architecture, design decisions, implementation details, operational constraints, security posture, developer workflows, and the expected user experience. It is intended both as a narrative for judges and as an engineering blueprint.

Executive summary
Nexus enables developers and teams to expose meaningful, safe entrypoints into their repositories with minimal effort. By using static analysis and lightweight heuristics, the Nexus Agent extracts public callables (functions, handlers, operationIds) and synthesizes a manifest describing commands, arguments, runtimes, and invocation examples. The Nexus Dashboard presents these to users for edit/review/publish. The local Nexus CLI then uses the published manifest to run chosen commands inside disposable containers, mapping CLI flags to function parameters automatically. Nexus removes boilerplate, reduces friction for repeated tasks, and makes internal automation discoverable and reproducible.

Pane 2 (Lazarus Engine): A local execution sandbox captures the code, writes it to disk, and executes it via sub-process.

Pane 3 (Truth): The system validates the output. If the code fails, the pane shatters. If it runs, we get the Ground Truth.

Demonstration: In the video, we task the system with ""High Mass"" logic problems: calculating sums of primes, solving combinatorics (""How many integers have three 7s?""), and resolving temporal paradoxes (""What was the date 10,000 days ago?"").

By leveraging Gemini 3 Pro’s advanced reasoning, image understanding, and text generation capabilities, the app transforms an emotional intention into a fully-personalized digital card—something that previously required manual design, writing, and media editing.

The experience is structured in three intuitive steps. First, the user enters the recipient’s name and selects the occasion. Second, the app enables a dynamic bouquet builder, where each chosen flower becomes semantic input to the AI. Gemini interprets these selections not merely as icons, but as emotional symbols—allowing the generated output to feel uniquely personal. Third, AI Studio generates a tailored poem, harmonized with the user’s bouquet and occasion context, and lets users choose background music to enhance the emotional experience.

The entire interactive process—UI logic, poem generation, animations, and sharing flow—was created through vibe coding in AI Studio Build. No traditional IDE, no manual setup. Gemini translated my prompt into a working, end-to-end application with editable code, real-time preview, and instant deployment, demonstrating how natural-language development can accelerate product creation.

LoveCard.ai addresses a universal human challenge: expressing feelings in a meaningful, beautiful, and effortless way. Whether for Valentine’s Day, anniversaries, apologies, or spontaneous affection, the app enables anyone to create a touching, share-ready card in seconds.

We asked ourselves: How can we build a fraud detector that our grandparents could actually use?

VerifyMate is a high-accessibility, personal fraud detection tool designed to verify screenshots of emails and text messages. It strips away the complexity of cybersecurity and replaces it with a simple, traffic-light interface:

Instead of just flagging a message, VerifyMate acts as a patient expert, explaining why something is suspicious in plain English (e.g., ""The sender claims to be your bank, but the email address is a generic Gmail account"").

VerifyMate leverages the multimodal capabilities of the Gemini API to ""see"" and ""reason"" like a security analyst.

I have built this using the Gemini API to run a team of smart helpers. A Question Agent creates questions from parts of the story and switches difficulty based on how the student does. To stop students from getting bored the system moves them up to harder questions after two correct answers in a row. To stop them from getting frustrated it moves them back to easier questions after two wrong answers in a row. If a student makes a mistake a Scaffolding Agent gives a helpful hint to guide them to the right part of the text.

Nutriscale AI pushes nutrition technology into territory previously limited to hospitals and research labs. It delivers ingredient-level accuracy by unifying three modalities—computer vision, real-time weight changes, and intelligent menu ingestion—into a single, end-to-end system built entirely in Google AI Studio.

How It Was Created
The project uses a modular agent architecture engineered in AI Studio:

Gemini Vision Pipeline: A custom segmentation and food-understanding model that identifies dishes, isolates components, predicts ingredients, and interprets volume using monocular depth and shape priors.

Smart-Tare Algorithm: A novel weight-delta method that transforms ordinary kitchen scales into multi-component measuring devices, capturing exact grams for each ingredient as users add or remove items.

Menu Intelligence: OCR + Gemini reasoning convert any menu photo into structured dishes, ingredient sets, and safe-to-eat recommendations—solving one of the hardest problems in metabolic nutrition.

Clinical Nutrition Engine: A deterministic pipeline powered by FoodData Central, specialized amino-acid datasets, and embedding-based food similarity models to compute precise macro, micro, and amino-acid profiles.

Why It Matters
For people managing metabolic disorders like HCU or PKU, precision is not optional—small nutritional errors can cause irreversible harm. Existing apps routinely miss the mark by 30–50%. Nutriscale AI replaces estimation with measurable truth.

Impact
Nutriscale AI reduces logging time from minutes to seconds, enables safer restaurant dining, and produces research-grade nutrition logs suitable for clinicians and large-scale studies.

While we visit doctors for acute illnesses, the majority of health outcomes are determined by daily decisions. Furthermore, generic health advice fails to account for individual medical histories and genetic backgrounds. There is a critical need for a system that bridges the gap between clinical medical records and daily lifestyle choices to prevent disease, reduce medical burdens, and improve overall quality of life.

Personal health is a multimodal challenge involving distinct, complex domains: nutrition, physiology, sleep science, psychology, and medicine. A single general-purpose AI model often struggles to maintain deep expertise across all these verticals simultaneously. An agentic architecture is the ideal solution because it allows for separation of concerns. These agents can operate independently to gather deep data, and then collaborate to form a holistic view of the user, mirroring a real-world board of health experts.

I built DailyHealth AI, a comprehensive health application powered by Google Gemini's API in the AI Studio.

Axilo handles the complexity of voice infrastructure, enabling any business or enterprise to automate calls faster, better, and more cost-effectively at scale. We enable businesses to automate calls with multilingual, realistic Voice AI agents. Businesses handle tens of thousands of calls every day, across various departments, including sales, support, collections, recruitment, and more. Axilo gives them the power to build and deploy Voice AI Agents directly from their transcripts and FAQs, allowing them to start automating calls immediately.

For global enterprises, phone calls remain a critical, high-volume channel across sales, support, and operations. Yet, the existing system is inefficient and incapable of handling real-world complexity:

Linguistic Complexity: Conversational AI must fluidly adapt to diverse regional accents, dialects, and spontaneous code-switching (e.g., mixing English with a local language), something only a natural, adaptive AI can manage.

Context-Dependent Performance: There is no ""one model to rule them all."" A support call requires high noise cancellation and low latency, while a recruitment call demands superior reasoning and complex context management. Integrating and managing hundreds of siloed models is an unwanted burden.

Cost Inefficiency at Scale: Automating millions of calls demands an engine engineered for efficiency—leveraging smaller, specialized models and intelligent routing to minimize operational costs.

Axilo is an enterprise-grade Voice AI Orchestration platform purpose-built to deploy thousands of concurrent, high-performance voice agents in days, not months.

It helps families and therapists turn daily practice into a game, especially for children who struggle with Spanish sounds like /rr/ or /s/.

The child completes four short “missions” on web or mobile:

1) Word Practice – Lira listens to each attempt and gives friendly, per-word feedback.  
2) Comic Story – a tiny personalised comic with TTS audio; the child repeats target words in context.  
3) Treasure Hunt – the child shows a photo or uses the camera; Gemini detects an object and turns it into a pronunciation challenge.  
4) Spy Mission – the child memorises and repeats secret code words in sequence; Gemini checks accuracy and order.

Behind the scenes, Lira Aventuras analyses pronunciation attempts and stores a lightweight performance history. Next sessions are auto-planned: the system selects phonemes, words and stories that match the child’s age, interests and recent success rate. Parents receive a structured, jargon-free summary of each session in natural language.

Hackathon Track: Education & Science (Reimagine Learning / Accelerate Discovery)

Yann LeCun, one of the godfathers of deep learning, once said something that stuck with me: ""The next breakthrough in AI may not come from an AI person.""

As a musician, artist, and lifelong tinkerer, this resonated deeply. I am fascinated by intelligence, but modern AI research is often gated behind a wall of dense mathematics and matrix multiplication. If you aren’t steeped in calculus or state-of-the-art algorithms, you are left on the sidelines.

But nature doesn’t need matrix multiplication to solve problems. Nature doesn't calculate gradients. Nature survives. Nature overcomes impossible odds with massive populations.  Biological systems are tightly coupled to their environment, evolving from the realities of our universe, where structure and function are inseparable.

NeuroLiquid is my answer to that disconnect. It is a gamified simulation designed to democratize access to one of the most exciting, understudied frontiers in AI: Liquid Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

In traditional deep learning, neurons are just variables in a static equation. In NeuroLiquid, every neuron is an independent organism with a will to thrive.

Using the advanced reasoning capabilities of Gemini 3 Pro, I ""vibe coded"" a system that moves away from rigid layers and towards biological realism.

Intelligence in NeuroLiquid isn't programmed; it emerges from the collective struggle of these individual agents trying to stay healthy.

Drawing inspiration from Sara Walker and Lee Cronin’s Assembly Theory, NeuroLiquid treats neurons as the fundamental building blocks of complexity.

In nature, DNA has a high ""assembly index""—it encodes the specific physical structure required for an organism to function. In this simulation, users act as the evolutionary force. You can physically grab neurons and move them around.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of emerging economies, yet millions are locked out of formal financing due to manual assessments, limited data visibility, high processing costs, and inconsistent credit decisions. Traditional financial institutions rely heavily on outdated evaluation methods that fail to capture the true potential of SMEs—especially in Africa.

In this hackathon, we built an advanced credit-intelligence system powered by Google DeepMind’s Gemini 3 Pro within AI Studio to transform the way financial institutions assess SME creditworthiness.

🔍 What We Built

A multi-agent pipeline built using Gemini 3 Pro that automatically ingests, processes, analyzes, and scores SME financial data at a level of depth that previously required expensive human analysts.

Key capabilities:

Financial Document Understanding:
Processes bank statements, sales records, P&Ls, balance sheets, MPesa statements, invoices, and receipts—extracting structured insights using Gemini’s advanced multimodal reasoning.

SME Health Diagnostics:
Computes financial ratios, liquidity measures, revenue stability, seasonality patterns, and debt stress indicators.

Predictive Credit Scoring:
A hybrid scoring system combining rule-based logic + Gemini reasoning to estimate repayment ability, creditworthiness, and risk category.

Fraud & Anomaly Detection:
Gemini identifies unusual activity, doctored statements, or conflicting financial signals.

Automated Loan Application Advisory:
The system recommends the optimal loan amount, best-fit financial institution, required documents, and approval likelihood.

🎯 Why This Matters

Financial institutions spend 40–60 minutes manually reviewing each SME application. Our system reduces this to under 2 minutes, while offering:

Higher accuracy

Lower operational costs

Improved approval rates for SMEs

Standardized and bias-reduced decisioning

A Generative Universe Storytelling Engine—an AI-powered platform that acts as an intelligent, improvisational Dungeon Master. For each new session, the engine dynamically creates a complete, unique universe with its own coherent rules, lore, and aesthetic. It then narrates adventures within that universe in real time using synchronized multimodal output: descriptive prose, dynamic voice narration, thematic illustrations, and managed dice rolls—all generated on the fly in response to completely free-form player input.

How

I engineered the system by structuring and iterating on sophisticated prompt commands in spanish to define the core behavior of DungeonAI.

Through iterative refinement, I shaped this core concept into a stable workflow where the AI:

Universe-builds first

Orchestrates narrative – interpreting open-ended player commands within the created framework

Maintains consistency – across all generated media

Why

This project represents a fundamental shift in interactive entertainment by:

Democratizing unlimited storytelling – Removing barriers of pre-written campaigns or the need for a human DM

Enabling emergent narrative freedom

Creating infinite replayability

Showcasing multimodal AI integration – Demonstrating how models like Gemini 3 Pro can orchestrate text, voice, and image generation cohesively

81,The playable token factory,A gamified arcade that turns millions of daily players into a distributed token factory for training the next generation of LLMs,,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 10, 2025","Project Description: TokenForge Trifecta
 The Core Concept
TokenForge Trifecta is an Intent Agent system built using Gemini 2.5 Pro (or Flash) that gamifies the creation of high-quality, verifiable data. It solves a critical problem in AI/agent development: authenticating human intent and focus during collaborative tasks. We use three classic arcade games (Jeopardy, Bingo, Mahjong) as fun, high-throughput interfaces to fuse human decisions with Gemini's reasoning, minting cryptographically watermarked tokens as proof of authentic, focused collaboration.

The Trifecta: Multimodal Agent Use Cases
The three games serve as distinct demonstrations of Gemini's multimodal and reasoning capabilities:

Jeopardy (Language Reasoning Agent):

Gemini Role: Generates complex, fact-based questions, testing its language generation and knowledge retrieval.

Human Role: Provides the correct answer.

Intent Action: The token proves the human agent focused on and correctly answered the knowledge-based query.

Bingo (Multimodal Vision/Categorization Agent):

Gemini Role: Validates an uploaded image/video clip (e.g., classifying a Red Car as a ""Vehicle""), demonstrating visual reasoning.

Human Role: Matches the validated item to a game card.

Intent Action: The token proves the human agent agreed with and correctly placed the multimodal classification result.

Mahjong (Categorical Pairing/Reasoning Agent):

Gemini Role: Reasons about logical pairs and categorizes complex data points (e.g., pairing ""Sun"" and ""Moon"" into ""Celestial Objects"").

Human Role: Makes the final pairing decision.

Intent Action: The token proves the human agent followed the agent's logic to create a new, labeled data sample.

The Innovation: Gaze Intent Watermarking
Our unique contribution is the Gaze Intent Watermark.

Every token is minted with a unique, SHA-256 hash.

This hash integrates the user's solved data and a real-time Intent Score (mocked via a formula simulating saccade, fixation, and pupil data).

Tagline: The end of ""Tab Fatigue."" The start of Active Mastery.

The Core Problem: A Crisis of Attention & Retention
Students today face a dual crisis:

""Scattered Resource Syndrome"" (Tab Fatigue): To learn a single topic, a student must alt-tab between YouTube for lectures, ChatGPT for explanations, Quizlet for testing, and Notion for writing. This constant context-switching destroys focus.

The ""Illusion of Competence"": AI tools like ChatGPT act as ""Butlers,"" generating endless summaries that students store but never read. Students possess the notes, but their brains remain empty. They are ""renting"" knowledge, not owning it.

Layman Notebooks is the antidote. It is a One-Stop AI Workspace that consolidates the entire learning journey—from first hearing a lecture to final exam prep—into a single, distraction-free window.

The Solution: A Unified ""Understanding-to-Testing"" Loop
We replaced the fragmented app stack with a seamless, three-phase workflow driven by a custom Multi-Model Orchestration Strategy.

Phase 1: Intelligent Capture (Replace YouTube/Otter.ai)
Layman Listens (Powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash): We use Flash’s sub-second latency to process live audio in real-time. The AI doesn't just transcribe; it detects ""Hot Zones"" (moments of high complexity or confusion) and generates a smart recap while the student focuses on listening.

Scan & Autopilot: Feed the app physical text or video links. The AI digests the material and generates structured notes in your preferred persona (Scholar, Meme-Lord, or Analogy Architect).

Community Lookup: Instead of a generic dictionary, our Lookup tool finds ""Snippets"" (analogies, mnemonics) written by other students. Users drag these from a Staging Area sidebar directly onto their desk.

Visuals (Gemini + Mermaid.js): With one click, complex text is converted into colorful Mindmaps or Flowcharts.

This project tackles a common problem in donations: people want to help, but they cannot see who needs what, where, and how urgently. Child welfare and social care facilities often share Amazon wishlists or simple web pages, yet these remain fragmented and hard to compare. As a result, some facilities are over-supported while others stay invisible.

Needs Visualization Map converts these unstructured wishlists into a geospatial, AI-powered dashboard. The system 
(1) ingests wishlist pages (HTML, screenshots, or text)
(2) uses Gemini 3 Flash Vision + Gemini 3 Pro to extract items, infer urgency levels with explanations, and generate narrative “support stories” 
(3) visualizes all facilities on an interactive Leaflet map. Donors also see “Today’s Top 5 Donation Opportunities,” ranked by Gemini across multiple facilities.

-Subtitle:: Bridging the gap between paper study and Computer-Based Testing for JEE/NEET aspirants.
-Track: Education

Project Description: Millions of students prepare for high-stakes competitive exams (like **JEE **and NEET) using static PDF question papers, yet the actual exams are *Computer-Based Tests (CBT)*. This disconnect hampers their ability to practice time management and exam strategy.

Rankify solves this by instantly converting any static PDF mock test into a fully interactive, timed, and scored online exam.

How I built it with Gemini 3: Leveraging Gemini 3 Pro’s native multimodality in Google AI Studio, I ""vibe coded"" a solution that goes beyond simple OCR. Gemini visually parses the complex layout of exam papers—correctly identifying distinct questions, scientific notation, diagrams, and multiple-choice options. It then instantly generates the application logic to render these components as a dynamic quiz interface, handling the ""translation"" from visual document to interactive code in real-time.

Why it matters: Rankify democratizes access to high-quality exam simulation.

118,The AI Interpreter for the Non-Verbal,Giving a voice to ALS and Stroke survivors using Gemini 3 Pro’s multimodal reasoning.,,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 12, 2025","Project Description: What it is: Aura Voice is a real-time communication tool for the 14 million people living with speech loss (ALS, Stroke, Autism). Instead of slow eye-tracking or typing, users simply interact with their environment. The app analyzes their live video feed—gestures, facial expressions, and objects—and instantly speaks their intent out loud.

How I built it: I ""vibe coded"" this entirely in Google AI Studio using Gemini 3 Pro. The core innovation isn't traditional code; it's a System Instruction that turns Gemini into an empathetic interpreter. The app streams video to the model, which fuses visual data (e.g., a user shivering) with object context (an open window) to generate natural language (""I am cold, please close the window""), which is then spoken via browser TTS.

Why it matters: Existing accessibility tools cost thousands of dollars and result in robotic, slow communication. Aura Voice democratizes this technology, using the device already in your pocket to restore not just words, but human connection and dignity.

It tells of how a person faces their inner self with independence and openness. When I applied for a master's program in 2022, I recorded my own podcast. At that time, my strongest feeling was loneliness. After a day of studying, I would hide in the school corridor late at night and use my voice to record my thoughts and reflections. Perhaps distant listeners would give me some sporadic feedback the next day, but I still vividly remember the loneliness I felt while recording.

Now, with AI, I can finally create a software that can guide me and accompany me to express those precious inspirations anytime, anywhere.

MoonEcho is that moon with whom I ""toast together"". When the AI speaks, the moon will flicker in sync. You can choose its personality: whether it is gently accompanying, sharply questioning, or curious. You can also define the language of its responses. At the start of the project, based on the Bullet Points you set, AI will generate a corresponding ""interview outline map"" in the background to keep the recording on track.

Through continuous debugging, I have made the AI's responses both informative and approachable, and to a certain extent, it knows how to guide the direction of the conversation. Most importantly, it can naturally have some pauses like a human, which connects well with the dialogue. This is essential for making an excellent podcast program.

I also revolutionized the previously complex audio editing interface, closely integrating it with conversations. Through audio-to-text conversion, podcast content can now be edited just like modifying a dialogue. The delay in AI responses can be eliminated with a single click.

137,Vastu Planner AI: Spatial Analysis with Vision,"Analyze floor plans for Vastu compliance using Gemini Vision, Shoelace Geometry, and the 32-Directional Grid.",,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 8, 2025","The Problem
For millions of home buyers in India and across the globe, Vastu Shastra (the ancient Indian science of architecture) is a non-negotiable part of purchasing a property. However, modern apartments often come with irregular shapes (cuts and extensions) that make traditional Vastu analysis difficult.

Most existing tools rely on simple square grids. They fail when a plot is L-shaped or irregular, leading to incorrect calculations of the Brahmasthan (Energy Center) and the true North alignment. Furthermore, identifying rooms manually is tedious and error-prone.

The Solution: Vastu Planner AI
Vastu Planner AI is a web-based spatial analysis tool that combines geometric algorithms with Gemini 1.5 Pro's Multimodal Vision capabilities. It allows users to upload any floor plan—sketch, blueprint, or Zillow screenshot—and instantly receive a Vastu compliance report based on the advanced ""32-Directional Grid"" system.

How It Works
Upload & Calibration: The user uploads a floor plan. Using a custom canvas interface, they define the boundary of the living space.

Geometric Intelligence: The app uses the Shoelace Formula (implemented via Gemini-generated code) to mathematically calculate the exact Centroid (Brahmasthan) of irregular polygons.

Grid Overlay: A dynamic 32-Directional Vastu Chakra overlays the image, centered on the calculated centroid. The user rotates the grid to align with the plan's North.

Gemini Vision Analysis: This is where the magic happens. We send the aligned floor plan to Gemini 1.5 Pro.

The Prompt: ""Analyze this image. Locate the functional zones (Kitchen/Fire Element, Toilet/Disposal, Master Bedroom/Earth Element) and return their coordinates.""

The Verdict: The app cross-references Gemini's visual identification with the geometric grid to determine if a specific room is in a ""Forbidden Zone"" (e.g., A toilet in the North-East).

Remedies: If a defect is found, Gemini generates specific, non-destructive remedies (e.g., ""Use a brass wire cor","React, Gemini","gemini, vastu, analysis, irregular, plan, grid, north, planner, geometric, vision",,,,False,False,False,3026.0,https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gemini-3/writeups/vastu-planner
138,self-healing AI code firewall,"An autonomous self-healing AI firewall built with Google AI Studio and Gemini 2.0 that detects, fixes, and protects against threats in real",,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 12, 2025","For this project, I built something I’ve personally never seen done in a simple way before: an AI-powered self-healing firewall.
The idea came from a very basic question — “Why do systems wait for a human to fix a security issue?”
Hackers don’t wait, and attacks happen instantly. So I wanted to build a system that reacts instantly too.

AI Ghost Firewall is a security layer that runs alongside an application and continuously checks for vulnerabilities.
If it finds something unsafe in the code or behavior, it doesn’t just show an alert — it actually generates a fix on its own.
This means the system can protect itself even when no developer is watching.
I designed the system around two main components:

It scans code and traffic patterns in real time.
For example, in my demo, the AI can catch things like insecure SQL queries or suspicious user input patterns that could lead to injection attacks.

If the system flags a vulnerability, another AI instantly creates a safer version of that code.
For the demo, I show how an unsafe SQL query can be converted into a parameterized, secure version within seconds.

Both parts work together, so the system becomes:

Automatic

Fast

Continuously learning

Independent of human reaction time
What Makes This Project Interesting

I kept the architecture simple, but the concept is powerful:

It doesn’t just identify security issues — it fixes them.

It doesn’t overload developers — it helps them.

It works in the background like a “ghost layer,” constantly watching and correcting.

It can adapt to new threats over time instead of relying on fixed rules.

Instead of traditional firewalls that only block requests, this one can rewrite unsafe code, generate safer alternatives, and log everything it does.
Cybersecurity usually requires fast reaction times, and humans simply can’t respond at the speed attacks happen.
With AI Ghost Firewall, the system doesn’t depend on a developer being online or checking logs.
It takes action immediately.

Health

AI Symptom Analyzer • Powered by Gemini 3 Pro

HealthSense is a multimodal health guidance system built with Gemini 3 Pro that helps users understand visible symptoms through simple, natural interaction. Many people experience rashes, swelling, discoloration, allergies, or mild injuries but struggle to interpret what they mean. HealthSense bridges this gap by combining image analysis, reasoning, and dialogue to provide safe and useful guidance.

Users start by uploading a photo of the visible symptom. Gemini 3 Pro analyzes the image, detecting visual patterns such as redness, texture changes, swelling, dryness, or irritation. HealthSense then asks a small set of medically relevant follow-up questions—duration, pain level, recent exposure, fever, and other factors that influence interpretation. After collecting this context, the system produces general explanations, safe home-care steps, what to avoid, and clear red-flag warnings that indicate when medical care is needed.

HealthSense also supports medication label interpretation. Users can take a picture of a medicine bottle or prescription label, and the app automatically highlights dosage instructions, allergens, safety notes, and common side effects in an easy-to-understand way.

The goal is not diagnosis. Instead, HealthSense empowers individuals with early awareness, safety guidelines, and decision support—all delivered through Gemini 3 Pro’s multimodal reasoning capabilities.

A disclaimer is included in every response:  
“HealthSense is not a medical device and does not diagnose conditions. For severe or unclear symptoms, consult a licensed healthcare professional.”

HealthSense demonstrates how multimodal AI can transform personal health understanding at global scale.

You go to a search engine, you ask for the capital of France, it gives you Paris. It is binary. It is static.

But the human mind doesn't work like that. The human mind is an engine of possibility. We lie awake at 3 AM wondering: What if I took that job in Tokyo? What if the internet was never invented? What if we could photosynthesize?

Existing AI chatbots are helpful assistants. But we didn't want to build an assistant. We wanted to build a telescope into the multiverse.

We built Divergent Paths.

Divergent Paths is not a text generator. It is an interactive simulation of alternative realities.

To make this experience feel fluid and ""alive,"" we needed speed for the spark, and depth for the understanding. We utilized a dual-model architecture:

The Spark (Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite):
We use the 2.5 Flash model for the high-speed generation of the path cards. It’s tuned with a high temperature (0.85+) to encourage wild, creative divergence. It creates the breadth of the multiverse instantly.

The Intellect (Gemini 1.5 Pro / 3 Pro Preview):
When you click the ""Sparkles"" icon for a Deep Analysis, we switch gears. We call upon the heavier reasoning capabilities of the Pro model. It acts as a sociologist, analyzing the immediate ripple effects, long-term societal shifts, and logical paradoxes of your scenario. It provides structure to the chaos.

The Grounding (Google Search Tool):
In our ""News"" mode, we don't just hallucinate. We use Gemini's grounding tools to fetch real-world headlines from the last 48 hours, and then we apply the ""What If"" algorithm to actual events. It is the intersection of fact and fiction.

We believe software should feel organic. It should breathe.

These delays stem from unordered traffic, a lack of civic lane discipline, and inefficient ambulance distribution.

The Solution: Automated Green Corridors To solve this, I have designed a system where city traffic signals are connected to a central server. When an ambulance is in active mode, the system automatically overrides signals within a specific threshold distance to Green. This clears congestion before the ambulance arrives, ensuring a continuous, unhindered path.

App Functionality The accompanying application features two distinct interfaces:

Patient Mode: Acts as an ""Uber for Ambulances,"" allowing users to request specific ambulance types and select their destination hospital immediately.

Emergency Crew Mode:

Education should be a right, not a privilege determined by language, ability, or geography. Yet 300 million students across India face invisible walls— diagrams inaccessible to blind learners, lectures lost on deaf students, complex concepts disconnected from their lived reality.

Samaveshi (meaning Inclusive in Sanskrit and Hindi) shatters these barriers with one elegant solution: photograph any educational content, receive it transformed for your needs.

The Innovation:
Leveraging Gemini 3 Pro's native multimodality, Samaveshi performs sophisticated cross-modal translation that was impossible before. A single uploaded image triggers simultaneous visual analysis, contextual reasoning, and cultural adaptation. The same physics diagram becomes a spatially-aware audio description for visually impaired students, a Telugu explanation using local pickle-making analogies, simplified text for dyslexic readers, and parent-friendly notes—all from one input.

Four Transformative Modes:

Hear Images: Spatial audio descriptions with tactile model suggestions
See Sound: Lecture transcripts with emotional context and visual cues
Easy Read: Simplified text with regional analogies and adjustable formatting
Class Pack: Teacher and parent materials in native languages

The Impact:
A rural student in Karnataka photographs an English textbook and learns photosynthesis through rice paddy farming. A blind student accesses complex diagrams. A parent who doesn't speak English helps their child with homework. One app replaces fragmented accessibility, translation, and tutoring tools.

For the 2.2 billion people with visual impairments, AI-assisted navigation has historically been a dangerous trade-off between speed and safety.

In accessibility, latency isn't just an inconvenience; it's a physical hazard. A user cannot pause their walk to wait for an API response. They need the reflexes of a guide dog combined with the reasoning of a human assistant.

LifeStream OS is a multimodal navigation system that solves this trade-off using a novel architecture I call the ""Reliability Sandwich."" It creates a cognitive prosthetic that operates at two speeds simultaneously:

This project creates a seamless fusion of Gemini's multimodal capabilities:

I utilized Gemini 3 Pro specifically for its deep reasoning capabilities in the Guardian Layer. Standard object detectors identify objects; Gemini 3 Pro understands situations.

Example: A simple model sees ""a wet floor sign."" Gemini 3 Pro infers ""Slip hazard ahead, path blocked, reroute left.""

The Reflex Layer relies on the low-latency WebSocket API. I engineered a robust audio/video streaming pipeline that sends PCM audio and Base64 image frames simultaneously, handling connection state management (reconnecting on drops) to ensure the user is never left ""blind"" due to a network glitch.

LifeStream OS demonstrates that accessibility tools don't have to be limited to basic OCR or slow Q&A. By leveraging the specific strengths of different Gemini models—the raw speed of Flash and the deep reasoning of Pro—we can build assistive technology that is both safe and fluid.

This architecture essentially gives a visually impaired user a ""super-sight"": the ability to walk confidently with reflex-speed feedback, while a super-intelligence watches their back for dangers they didn't even know were there.",Gemini,"gemini, accessibility, speed, user, reasoning, technology, navigation, trade, latency, hazard",,,,False,False,False,1812.0,https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gemini-3/writeups/new-writeup-1765006896578

Many people experienced firsthand what we call Mute English - years of studying vocabulary lists, grammar rules, and textbook dialogues about airplanes, renewable energy, and global economics, yet struggling to describe the simple things around me: the street food vendor's steaming baozi, the shared bicycle on the corner, or the potted plants on my balcony.

Across the developing world, language education often feels abstract and detached from daily reality. Students in rural India, Indonesia, or Latin America memorize words for ""helicopter"" and ""solar panel"" from standardized curricula, but don't know how to talk about the clothes they wear, the meals they eat, or the neighborhoods they live in.

The gap is clear:

LingoVision turns this paradigm upside down by making your real life the curriculum.

""From Chaos to Curation."" Deskscape is not just a cleaning tool; it is a multimodal AI consultant that leverages Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning to bridge the gap between your chaotic reality and your dream workspace.

▶ Inspiration
We often rationalize our messy desks, thinking, ""Maybe this chaos just suits my creative process."" But do you remember the spark you felt when you first bought that desk? The joy of setting it up perfectly? That memory proves that the current chaos isn't a style—it's complacency.

Deskscape was born from this realization. We wanted to recapture that ""Day 1"" feeling. Guided by timeless wisdom like ""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"" and ""The objective of cleaning is to feel happiness,"" we realized that organization isn't just a chore—it's a way to reclaim our original mindset. We asked: ""What if AI could help us navigate back to that clarity? What if it could bridge the gap between our messy reality and the curated sanctuary we truly desire?""

▶ What it does
Deskscape creates a personalized feedback loop for your environment using three core pillars:

Multimodal Context Injection (Vision + Voice) Deskscape uses Gemini 3 to process visual and audio inputs simultaneously. It doesn't just see a messy desk; it listens. When a user captures their desk and says, ""I need a dual monitor setup for coding, but keep the books,"" Gemini synthesizes the visual data with the user's intent to generate a context-aware action plan.

Target-Driven Gap Analysis We moved beyond static analysis. With the ""Set Goal"" feature, users can select an aspirational ""Wannabe Desk."" Gemini 3 then performs a Gap Analysis, comparing the user's current setup (As-Is) with the target image (To-Be), providing specific steps to bridge the aesthetic and functional gap.

The Concept: Reverse Vibe Coding

""Vibe Coding"" implies letting AI write the software while you relax. We built the opposite. AI Dev Academy is the ""Anti-Autopilot"" for learners.

Inspiration:

Inspired by teaching Computational Thinking in Python, this project recognizes that while the method may slow deep coding dives, it is foundational and critical for success. We built an architecture that prioritizes this foundational logic over speed.

How It Works:

We orchestrated a Multi-Agent pipeline to mimic a strict Technical Lead that forces you to think:

The Architect (Gemini 2.5 Flash): Interviews you about your app idea, then instantly synthesizes a ""Project Manifest"" containing a custom syllabus and hidden unit tests.

The Tutor: A Socratic agent that uses the manifest to guide you. It knows the solution but refuses to output code, forcing you to type and learn.

The Reviewer (Gemini 3 Pro): Analyzes your final code for logic and style, grading you like a Senior Dev.

The Tech:

We focused on optimizing latency and reasoning by chaining Gemini 2.5 Flash for the interactive stages and Gemini 3 Pro for deep analysis.

Yet, despite being rich, expressive, and fully-fledged languages, sign languages remain inaccessible to most hearing people. This creates communication gaps in essential places such as hospitals, schools, workplaces, government offices, customer service, and everyday interactions. Interpreters are often unavailable, too expensive, or not trained in specific sign languages. Even in countries with strong accessibility laws, interpreters cannot be present 24/7.

At the same time, millions of people want to learn sign language—teachers, nurses, customer support agents, emergency responders, and family members. But traditional sign language learning relies heavily on human instructors, one-way video tutorials, or static images that don’t show expressive movement, transitions, or context.

SignSpeak AI solves these problems with a real-time, multimodal AI interpreter powered by Gemini 3 Pro. It enables fluid, two-way communication between Deaf and hearing individuals by translating sign language into speech/text and generating AI-driven animated sign demonstrations from spoken or typed input. It also works as an interactive tutor, helping people learn sign language through explanations, gesture breakdowns, and visual animations.

What We Built

SignSpeak AI is an AI-powered sign language translation and learning system built in Gemini 3 Pro on AI Studio, using its multimodal understanding and real-time conversation features. Unlike simple sign-learning apps or dictionary-style tools, SignSpeak AI focuses on live, natural, conversational communication.

Core Idea

The platform takes sign-language input (video from camera) and turns it into real-time speech or text, and also takes speech or text and converts it into animated, human-like sign gestures. This creates a powerful communication loop that works instantly and naturally.

https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1xePUbo9RknmdSYUmM2qhBmRjF_sr5u-m?fullscreenApplet=true

The Problem

When you're feeling down, everyone says ""listen to happy music."" But research shows this approach often backfires — your brain resists the sudden emotional jump, making you feel worse.

The Solution

TherapyTune applies the ISO Principle from music therapy: meet the listener where they are, then gradually guide them toward balance. Instead of recommending a single song, it designs a 5-song emotional journey.

How It Works

Users adjust five psychological axes (Energy, Reality, Temporal, Repetition, Hedonic) using sliders, visualized in real-time on a radar chart. They can optionally add voice recordings or text for AI-assisted refinement. After selecting preferred genres, Gemini generates a personalized playlist where each song shifts emotional coordinates by maximum 0.2 — ensuring gradual, non-jarring transitions.

Key Features

Why It Matters

Music's psychological effects are scientifically proven. Even perceived alignment (""this feels right for me"") creates comfort. TherapyTune transforms vague emotional states into structured journeys, making self-understanding accessible.

Career Compass 3.0 is an AI-powered career co-pilot that analyzes everything a student or early professional already has—marksheets, project screenshots, LinkedIn profile, GitHub repos, certificates, and even written answers about interests—and turns it into a personal skill graph, missing-skill roadmap, best-fit career paths with expected salary bands, a daily learning plan, and an auto-generated CV + portfolio.

It uses Gemini 3 Pro’s multimodal and advanced reasoning capabilities to understand unstructured, real-world data from multiple sources and convert it into actionable, personalized career guidance that feels like talking to a personal mentor who has read your entire academic and project history.

Students and young professionals struggle with three major problems:

Scattered Profile Data:
Grades live in PDFs, skills in GitHub, projects in Google Drive screenshots, achievements in random certificates, and experience in LinkedIn. No single system integrates all of this to understand who they really are.

Confusing Career Choices:
They see vague labels like “Data Scientist”, “Product Manager”, “Backend Engineer” but don’t know:

Am I actually ready for this role?

What exactly am I missing?

What salary level is realistic for my current skill set?

Action Gap (What should I do today?):
Even when they know their career goal, they don’t know:

Which courses to take in what order

What projects to build to stand out

How to structure their CV and portfolio for that specific role

Most tools solve only one small piece: resume builders, generic roadmaps, or static job descriptions. There is no unified, AI-first system that eats all your real data (marksheets, code, certificates, LinkedIn, etc.) and outputs a grounded, personalized career map.

Career Compass 3.0 is a web/mobile application that acts as a multimodal career intelligence layer for each user.

It generates a decision tree of possibilities, exploring",,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 6, 2025","""Traditional AI looks for a needle in a haystack. OncoSwarm burns the haystack and builds a magnet.""

In standard drug discovery, failure is a dead end. When a candidate molecule fails a lab test due to toxicity or poor binding, the research path is often abandoned.

OncoSwarm fundamentally changes this paradigm. It is an Agentic AI System powered by Gemini 3 that treats failure as data. Instead of thinking in a linear line, OncoSwarm thinks like an Evolutionary Tree.

When a drug fails, OncoSwarm triggers a massive Parallel Bifurcation:

Keeps the core structure but tweaks it to fix the specific failure (e.g., ""Add a hydroxyl group to reduce liver toxicity"").

####Path B (The Innovator):
Pivots to a completely new chemical scaffold or mechanism (e.g., ""Switch from inhibitor to PROTAC degrader"").

By simulating thousands of these ""What If"" scenarios simultaneously, we turn a single failed data point into a roadmap for a cure.

The system does not use one agent; it uses a **Swarm of Agents **operating in parallel.

Input: Raw medical data (PDF Pathology Reports, CT Scans, Genetic Sequencing logs).

Action:  Uses Gemini 3's multimodal capabilities to OCR and parse complex medical data.

Output: Identifies the precise ""Enemy"" (e.g., NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation and TP53 resistance).

Instead of a chat interface, the core logic is a Decision Tree.

Root: The Cancer Target.

Branches: Every hypothesis spawns 5-10 parallel branches.

Leaves: Each leaf is a generated 3D molecular structure (PDB/SDF).

Pruning: ""Critic Agents"" automatically kill branches that violate laws of physics or chemistry, saving compute for promising paths.

Scenario: A Doctor/Researcher marks a drug as FAILED.

Reaction:The system does NOT apologize. It asks ""Why?""

Action: If the reason is ""Hepatotoxicity,"" the swarm automatically searches global databases for structural analogs that solve hepatotoxicity in similar compounds and generates a new branch.

216,DermoAssist AI: A Multimodal Dermatology Assistant for Doctors,An AI tool that analyzes skin lesion images and symptoms to generate differential diagnoses and clinical reports.,,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 11, 2025","I built DermoAssist AI because skin issues are incredibly common - more than one in three people deal with a dermatology concern every year. But getting real help is slow. In many places, seeing a dermatologist can take three to six months, and early detection makes a huge difference. For example, melanoma caught early has a 99 percent survival rate, but that drops dramatically if it’s found late.

DermoAssist AI is a simple tool for doctors: upload a lesion photo, add any symptoms, and hit Analyze. Gemini 3 Pro looks at both the image and the text together, then gives a differential diagnosis with confidence percentages, a plain-language explanation of its reasoning, and suggestions for next steps like monitoring, biopsy, or referral. It’s not meant to replace a clinician - just help them make faster, clearer decisions.

Remix.,"A visual community platform to browse AI prompt results, swipe for code, and adapt any use cases instantly using Gemini-powered Smart Remix.",,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 12, 2025","PromptNote reimagines prompt engineering as a visual, social experience, essentially ""Github meets Instagram"" for the AI era.

The Problem Existing: Prompt libraries are static text lists. They fail to show context, a prompt that works for coding in Gemini might fail for writing in GPT-4. Users struggle to see the result before they copy prompts, and adapting other's prompt to your own needs is difficult.

Solution: PromptNote solves this with a ""Result-First"" UI. Users browse a feed of generated images or code. A simple Swipe Left reveals the exact prompt, model settings (e.g. Gemini 3), and scenario tags. The killer feature is ""Smart Remix"": a button that uses AI to instantly rewrite a shared prompt to fit the user's specific topic.

How I Built It: I built PromptNote using Google AI Studio’s ""Vibe Coding"" workflow.

Vibe Coding Architecture: I used Gemini 3 Pro to architect a complex Single Page Application with a simulated backend. The model handled state management and design logic entirely through natural language intent.

Agentic ""Smart Remix"": The core innovation uses Gemini 3 Pro’s reasoning capabilities. I instructed the model to act as a semantic agent that ""transfers"" the logic of a prompt to a new domain while preserving the original structure.

Traditional GIS tools (like ArcGIS) are too complex for average business leaders, while standard dashboards lack spatial reasoning. This application bridges that gap using Gemini 3 Pro.

It functions as a strategic partner: users can upload sales data (CSV/GeoJSON) or site plans (images), and the agent analyzes them to answer critical questions like ""Where should we expand?"" or ""Assess flood risk for these assets.""

Key capabilities include:

This tool empowers small businesses and NGOs to make sophisticated, data-driven location decisions without needing a data science team.

How I created it:

I built the frontend with React 19 and Tailwind CSS, using Leaflet for the interactive map interface.
The core intelligence is powered by the Google GenAI SDK (gemini-3-pro-preview).

System Prompting: I engineered a robust system prompt that instructs Gemini to output a strict JSON schema. This allows the AI to ""control"" the map placing markers, drawing polygons, and adjusting zoom levels, while simultaneously generating a Markdown strategic analysis.

Multimodality: I used Gemini's vision capabilities to process user-uploaded images (base64 encoded) alongside text prompts, enabling the model to ""see"" the map or site plans.

Data Handling: I integrated papaparse for client-side CSV handling and created a mock ""Data Cleaning"" pipeline to demonstrate how AI can assist with data quality.

Visualization: I implemented custom Leaflet rendering for heatmaps and complex polygons based on the AI's structured output.

Impact:
Location is the #1 factor for success in retail, logistics, and real estate, yet quality analysis is expensive. Geo-Decision Copilot makes this accessible.

Healthcare today faces a strange paradox. We have access to more medical knowledge than ever before, yet the ""first mile"" of getting sick—that vulnerable moment when you realize something is wrong—feels lonelier and more confusing than ever.

When you wake up feeling awful at 2 AM, your options are limited and stressful. You can panic-search your symptoms online, usually leading to terrifying and incorrect conclusions. You can struggle with rigid ""symptom checker"" apps that feel like interrogations. Or, you can wait it out, hoping it’s nothing serious, potentially missing critical warning signs.

We built VitalVibe to change this story. VitalVibe isn't just a smart app; it’s a compassionate, observant health partner. It is designed to bridge the gap between that first moment of uncertainty and the professional care you actually need.

The core issue isn't a lack of information; it’s that we expect sick people to act like doctors.

Most digital tools today rely on what we call ""Passive Input."" They assume that when you are sick, anxious, or in pain, you can perfectly describe what is happening to you. They assume you know which symptoms matter. But that is rarely true.

The ""Silent"" Symptoms When we are unwell, we focus on what hurts the most—like a stomach ache. But we often miss the visible signs that tell the real story. We might not notice that our skin looks a bit pale, our eyes are slightly yellow, or that we are subconsciously protecting one side of our body when we move. Text-based apps are ""blind"" to these clues. If you don't type it, they don't know it.

🚀 The Pitch
We all talk to our plants, but what if they could talk back? The biggest friction in plant care isn't lack of information—it's a lack of connection. A yellowing leaf is silent; it doesn't tell you if it's drowning or thirsty. ""The Plant Therapist"" solves this by using Gemini 3 Pro to bridge the interspecies communication gap. We don't just diagnose your plant; we give it a voice, a personality, and a medical history.

🌿 The Problem
Houseplants are booming, but plant mortality is high. Most owners fail because they misinterpret visual cues. Existing apps are sterile databases—they tell you what is wrong, but they don't make you care until it's too late. They lack the ""vibe"" that makes plant parenthood rewarding.

💡 The Solution
The Plant Therapist is a premium, multimodal web application that combines high-precision visual diagnostics with creative persona generation.

Visual Bio-Feedback: You snap a photo. Gemini 3 Pro analyzes biological markers (turgidity, chlorosis, soil texture) with expert precision.

Persona Translation: The AI doesn't just output data; it ""roleplays"" the plant based on its health and species.

A thirsty Peace Lily becomes a dramatic diva: ""I am literally fainting. The drama is real. Water me now.""

A healthy Cactus becomes a stoic introvert: ""I'm thriving. Please continue to ignore me.""

Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of death among women in Sub-Saharan Africa due to limited access to timely, accurate screening. Conventional Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) is low-cost but highly subjective, operator-dependent, and often misses precancerous lesions.

DawaMom is an AI-powered screening solution designed to address these barriers by delivering specialist-grade, real-time diagnostic support directly to frontline healthcare providers such as nurses and midwives. Leveraging a fine-tuned MedSigLIP computer vision model trained on 5,500 cervix images, DawaMom achieves 96.7% accuracy and F1-scores of 0.95–1.00 across Normal, CIN1–3, and Suspected Cancer categories. The system runs on accessible, low-cost devices — any smartphone with a 16M+ pixel camera, enabling task-shifting, standardized assessments, and immediate clinical guidance without reliance on laboratories or specialists.

By providing automated image quality checks, multi-class lesion classification, triaged risk scoring, and actionable recommendations, DawaMom overcomes VIA’s limitations of subjectivity, poor lesion granularity, and lack of documentation. All AI outputs are stored digitally, supporting quality assurance and remote specialist review.

1. Introduction: Why We Started This

Every school today has access to smart boards, digital content and the internet. But the actual classroom experience looks almost identical to what it was 20 years ago. Teachers still rely heavily on pages of NCERT textbooks. Students still struggle to visualise what they read. Concepts become harder from grade 8 onwards and by grade 11 and 12, large portions of science become purely abstract.

Across chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics, students repeatedly face the same problem:
they can read the definition but cannot see the idea.
Teachers try their best but often don’t have the tools or time to create meaningful visual aids.

This gap is not small. It affects millions of learners in India alone.

Our goal was simple: turn every NCERT concept into an interactive experience that finally makes sense.

2. The Core Problem

• Smart boards are being used like projectors, not learning tools
• Students memorise diagrams instead of understanding concepts
• Teachers struggle to explain complex topics without a visual aid
• Advanced concepts like FCC, BCC, chemical bonding, reaction mechanisms or physics phenomena cannot be shown live
• Educational content is scattered across textbooks, PDFs and YouTube videos

The result is predictable. Confusion increases, interest drops and learning becomes passive.

3. Our Approach: Turning Textbooks into Interactive Modules

We built a system that starts with the NCERT textbook and converts each chapter into a complete learning experience. The pipeline works like this:

a. Concept Extraction with NotebookLM

We use NotebookLM to extract:
• key formulas
• core definitions
• textbook explanations
• important diagrams
• step wise reasoning
• teacher friendly notes

This ensures that the content stays aligned with NCERT and remains authentic and accurate.

Built on Event-Driven Archi,,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 12, 2025","Project kikipounamu is a production-ready, high-performance Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system architected as a distributed microservices platform. Built from the ground up to solve the critical pain points of traditional monolithic ASR systems, this project delivers enterprise-grade reliability, scalability, and performance for real-time speech-to-text processing.

At its core, kikipounamu represents a paradigm shift in ASR system design: by leveraging Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) with Go language high-performance gateways and Redis Streams message bus, I've achieved complete decoupling between compute-intensive operations (ASR inference) and I/O-intensive operations (network connections). This architectural innovation enables the system to handle massive concurrent loads while maintaining exceptional reliability and responsiveness.

Traditional ASR systems face three fundamental challenges in production environments:

Concurrency Bottleneck: Monolithic Python-based systems struggle under high concurrent loads due to Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations, leading to degraded performance and service crashes when handling hundreds of simultaneous audio streams.

Resource Isolation Failure: When network I/O and heavy computation share the same process space, network saturation can starve GPU resources, while GPU computation can block network responses - creating a cascading failure scenario.

Scalability Limitations: Vertical scaling hits hardware limits quickly, while horizontal scaling of monolithic systems wastes resources by duplicating both lightweight network handlers and heavyweight AI models.

My solution delivers:

I made a strategic technology choice that leverages each language's strengths:

Go Gateway Layer:

Python Worker Layer:

This separation enables me to scale each layer independently based on actual bottlenecks: spinning up more lightweight Go instances for network I/O, or provisioning GPU-equipped machines for computation.

The information is there, but managing it becomes harder as the data grows. It's difficult to track changes over time, compare pits, or understand what’s happening without manually pulling numbers from multiple files.

This project was built to make that entire workflow simpler. The goal was to create a web app where the environmental team can record sampling data consistently, explore trends quickly, and compare pit conditions side by side. Instead of juggling multiple sheets, everything is now centralized and visualized.

I used Gemini through Google AI Studio and Vibe Coding to help with UI generation, Firestore schema planning, and boilerplate logic. This allowed me to focus more on designing a workflow that feels natural for real field and reporting conditions.

The app replaces the Google Form workflow with a cleaner and more structured input system.  
Users can enter:

For development and testing, the app currently uses Mock Mode (LocalStorage via mockService.ts), but all logic is written to support Firestore once configured with real credentials.

The dashboard gives users a quick overview of what’s happening across pits. It includes:

Executive Summary
Vitals AI is a next-generation fitness and wellness platform leveraging Gemini 3 Pro to create deeply personalized workout and nutrition plans. The key innovation is the AI Form Correction System, where the app analyzes the user’s exercise video and, using Gemini, provides instant, human-like corrective feedback. Vitals AI offers an adaptive, truly intelligent coaching experience that goes beyond simple tracking.

The Challenge
The main flaw in current health apps is the lack of deep personalization and technical feedback on exercise execution. They cannot dynamically adapt to body changes, available food resources, or incorrect form, which slows user progress and increases the risk of injury.

The Solution: A Gemini 3 Pro Powered Architecture
We utilized the Gemini 3 Pro model as the core intelligence engine to implement three primary innovative features:

A. Comprehensive Plan Generation & Coaching:

Gemini's Role: Gemini 3 Pro processes all comprehensive user data (age, goals, physical measurements, and the body type analysis from images).

Structured Output: We employed Gemini's Structured Output capabilities to generate a detailed, multi-phase program (e.g., four weeks) in a machine-readable format (JSON). This output includes workout specifics, motivational Coach's Notes, and a precise meal plan.

Intelligent Safety: Gemini is prompted to logically evaluate the safety of the planned calorie target and generates a detailed Safety Warning if the goal is deemed physically unsafe.

B. AI Form Correction: The Differentiator

Process: The user records or live-streams themselves performing an exercise.

Subtitle: Any slides, PDF, or poster transformed into a summary, a concept map, a 20-question quiz, flashcards, and a five-minute recap in seconds.

Project Description
SlideCrunch is a study copilot built in Google AI Studio with Gemini 3 Pro Preview. It converts presentations, PDFs, posters, and screenshots into a coherent, exportable study pack. The goal is not merely to compress text, but to rebuild the learning experience around the original content. Users upload a file and receive a two-layer summary that preserves coverage while staying readable, a concept map that reveals relationships between ideas, a twenty-question short-answer quiz suitable for quick formative checks, an Anki-ready flashcard set for spaced repetition, and a five-minute recap script that supports time-boxed review or voice-over. All artifacts are generated in English, Dutch, or Turkish and respect two style modes: Simple for short sentences and minimal jargon, and Detailed for slightly longer sentences with brief rationale. The pipeline is engineered so that every artifact is produced from aligned intermediate structures, which keeps the outputs consistent with each other and easy to export or audit.

Impact and Motivation
Learners and educators routinely spend more time preparing materials than engaging with ideas. A typical deck of twenty to thirty slides demands an hour of skimming to identify core points, more time to draft practice questions, and even more time to assemble flashcards. Instructors often need a concept overview for class discussion and a quick quiz to check understanding, while students want something they can study immediately before or after class. SlideCrunch collapses this workflow into a single step. The summary takes the place of manual note consolidation. The concept map substitutes for whiteboard diagrams and connects otherwise isolated facts. The quiz and flashcards supply retrieval practice without extra authoring.

267,OmniBase Architect,"A next-generation Backend-as-a-Service dashboard demonstrating Unified Trust Layer orchestration, multi-token identity mapping, and AI-assis",,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 12, 2025","Overview
OmniBase is a next-generation Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) designed to solve the ""Integration Hell"" of modern web development. Unlike traditional BaaS platforms (like Firebase or Supabase) that act as walled gardens, OmniBase operates as a Universal Identity Broker. It unifies authentication from any provider, maps it to a single internal permission system, and securely orchestrates direct access to databases, storage, and external 3rd-party APIs—eliminating the need for complex backend ""glue code.""

The Problem
Modern developers suffer from Identity Fragmentation and Service Sprawl.

They use Auth0/Clerk for login, Postgres for data, and Stripe/OpenAI for logic.

Connecting these requires writing and maintaining insecure ""glue code"" (Lambda/Cloud Functions) just to manage API keys and translate user tokens between services.

The Solution: OmniBase
OmniBase provides a single, high-performance control plane that sits between the Frontend and the fragmented backend ecosystem.

Key Features
Universal Trust Layer (BYO-Auth):

Accepts identity tokens from any provider (Auth0, Clerk, Firebase, Cognito, or custom legacy systems).

Automatically validates, normalizes, and maps these external identities to a unified internal User ID.

Benefit: Zero vendor lock-in for authentication. Switch auth providers without rewriting your database policies.

Outbound API Proxy (The Glue-Code Killer):

Allows frontend clients to call third-party APIs (e.g., /proxy/stripe/charge, /proxy/openai/completion) securely.

OmniBase intercepts the request, validates permissions, and injects the secret API keys server-side before forwarding the call.

Benefit: Build complex integrations securely from the client side without managing a backend server.

Unified Data & Realtime Engine:

Built on PostgreSQL. Auto-generates REST and GraphQL APIs from your schema.

Enforces access control via native Row Level Security (RLS) using the unified identity.

268,Multi-Agent Dev Studio,"Web IDE that turns a single prompt into a live, editable web app using parallel multi-agent workflows powered by Gemini 3 Pro.",,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 9, 2025","Multi-Agent Dev Studio is a web-based IDE built with Gemini 3 Pro.
From a single, simple prompt, it generates a high-quality web page with a live preview and full source code directly in the browser. Behind the scenes, multiple specialized agents run in parallel to take the roles of planner, designer, and engineer.

Problem

Developers, indie hackers, and creators often want to quickly try ideas as working web pages. However:

Writing HTML/CSS/JS from scratch is time-consuming.

Typical single-agent AI tools often produce unstructured or low-quality code.

Switching between a prompt tool, editor, and preview window breaks the creative flow.

As a result, many ideas never make it past the “sketch in your head” stage.

Solution: Multi-Agent Dev Studio

Multi-Agent Dev Studio reduces this friction.
The user types one high-level instruction such as:

“Create a landing page for a new AI productivity app with a hero section and three feature cards.”

The app then:

Interprets the request and plans the page structure.

Generates copy and layout suggestions.

Produces clean, editable HTML/CSS/JS.

Renders an instant web preview in the same interface.

Users can inspect or copy the code, tweak it with follow-up prompts, and immediately see the result.

How it uses Gemini 3 Pro

The core of the app is a parallel multi-agent workflow built on top of Gemini 3 Pro:

A planning agent that understands the prompt and defines the sections of the page.

A UI/content agent that writes the text and suggests layout patterns.

A coding agent that turns the plan into structured HTML/CSS/JS.

A review agent that checks and refines the output to keep it consistent.

Because these agents run in parallel, the user gets fast feedback from a single prompt, instead of waiting for multiple separate conversations.

Target users & impact

The primary target users are people who want to “get running code and source quickly” without setting up a local environment:

Short Description:

IdeaLaunch is an AI-powered creative incubator designed to break cognitive fixation. Leveraging Google’s Gemini 2.5 models, it transforms a simple text input into a spectrum of distinct visual concepts—from practical evolutionary upgrades to surreal, experimental abstractions.

What I Built:

I built a web-based “Divergent Thinking Engine” that acts as a brainstorming co-pilot. Unlike standard image generators that merely illustrate prompts, IdeaLaunch first uses gemini-2.5-flash to deeply deconstruct the user’s theme semantically. It then applies one of three creative strategies—Evolution (optimization), Revolution (structural transformation), or Experimental (abstract logic)—to generate unique conceptual frameworks. Finally, gemini-2.5-flash-image renders these ideas into high-fidelity visuals instantly.

Key Features:

Three-Tier Divergence Architecture: Control creativity “temperature”—from safe functional tweaks to physics-defying reimaginings.
Infinite Semantic Adaptation: Generates dynamic, context-aware prompts (e.g., treating “Chair” and “Cloud” with entirely different design logics).
Concept Board Export: Auto-compiles ideas into professional PDF mood boards for design reviews or classroom use.
Local Persistence: Securely saves creative history locally via IndexedDB.
Technical Stack:

Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (Neo-Brutalism design)
AI Core: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (reasoning) + Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (visualization)
Storage: IndexedDB
Value:

For designers, writers, and educators, IdeaLaunch eliminates “blank canvas paralysis.” It doesn’t just show you an image—it reveals six radically different ways to think about your subject, expanding the realm of possibility before you even draw the first line.","gemini, React, Gemini, TypeScript","gemini, idealaunch, image, flash, creative, into, design, divergent, thinking, engine",,,,False,False,False,1839.0,https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gemini-3/writeups/new-writeup-1765025901784
270,MediGuard: AI-Powered Hospital Compliance Auditor,Bridging the gap between written safety protocols and physical reality using Gemini 3 Pro's multimodal reasoning.,,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 6, 2025","Inspiration :
As a Software Implementor working with Hospital Information Systems (SIMRS), I witness ""Compliance Fatigue"" daily. Hospitals have strict safety protocols (JCI, WHO standards), but auditing them manually is slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error. A tired surveyor might miss a loose oxygen tank or a tripping hazard, which could lead to critical patient injuries.

I wanted to answer the question: Can we use Multimodal AI not just to ""see"" a room, but to ""audit"" it like a Senior Safety Officer, pinpointing exactly where the dangers lie?

What it does :
MediGuard is an intelligent auditing platform that transforms static SOPs into active visual analysis.

Visual Grounding (New Feature): Unlike standard image analysis, MediGuard draws precise red bounding boxes around detected hazards. If an oxygen tank is unsecured, the AI circles it—proving it understands the spatial location of the violation.

Context-Aware Analysis: Users can select specific protocols (General Ward, ICU Infection Control, or ER Trauma). The AI analyzes the image strictly against that specific text.

AI Consultant Chat (New Feature): After the audit, users can chat with an AI Consultant to ask follow-up questions like ""How do I fix this cable issue cheaply?"" or ""Which JCI chapter does this violate?"".

Instant Scoring: It generates a quantified Safety Score (0-100%) and an executive summary for hospital management.

How I built it (The Vibe Coding Experience) 
I built MediGuard entirely using Google AI Studio Build with Gemini 3 Pro. The process was iterative ""Vibe Coding"":

Technical Deep Dive
The core innovation lies in the System Prompt Engineering and Schema Definition:

271,ContractShield Enterprise: The First Multimodal Agentic Legal Guardian,erifying the whole truth by cross-referencing legal contracts with multimodal evidence (audio & images) using Gemini 3Pro.,,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 6, 2025","1. The Problem
Contracts are the operating system of the modern world, yet the review process is critically broken. We sign static PDFs, but the real agreements often happen in unstructured formats: verbal promises made during meetings, casual email threads, or handshake deals.

Traditional Legal AI is ""blind"" to this reality. It only analyzes the text within the four corners of the document. If a landlord verbally promises ""pets are allowed"" but the contract says ""no pets,"" a standard AI reviewer will mark the contract as safe. The tenant signs, and gets evicted.

2. The Solution
ContractShield Enterprise is an agentic workspace that uses Gemini 1.5 Pro’s advanced multimodal capabilities to bridge the gap between what is signed and what was actually promised.

It is not just a document reviewer; it is a Forensic Truth Engine. By ingesting the contract (PDF) alongside external evidence (Audio recordings of meetings, Screenshots of emails), ContractShield detects ""Multimodal Conflicts""—contradictions between written terms and verbal/informal agreements.

3. How We Use Gemini (Technical Depth)
We leverage the unique capabilities of the Gemini API to power three core engines:

Multimodal Reasoning (Audio-to-Text Cross-Check):

We utilize Gemini’s native ability to process audio and images alongside text without external transcription tools.

Workflow: The system feeds the lease agreement (Text) and the meeting recording (Audio) into Gemini's context window. We prompt the model to identify specific contradictions.

Result: Gemini identifies that at timestamp 00:42 of the audio, a verbal consent was given that contradicts Clause 5 of the text.

Long Context Window:

Legal diligence requires analyzing dozens of files simultaneously. Gemini’s 1M+ token context window allows ContractShield to hold the entire ""Deal Room"" (Contract + History of emails + Hours of audio) in memory at once to perform holistic reasoning.

One-Sentence Elevator Pitch

Resolve is an AI-powered relationship mentor that blends psychology with Nonviolent Communication (NVC) to transform emotional conflict into structured connection—guiding couples from destructive fights toward restorative dialogue.

Project Description

In modern relationships, we communicate more than ever—but truly connect far less. Text messages filter out tone and emotional nuance, allowing minor misunderstandings to escalate. In face-to-face conflict, the amygdala hijack pushes partners to say things they later regret. Most couples lack a safe buffer zone to process disagreements, leading to emotional erosion over time.

Resolve is not just another messaging app—it is a relationship health mentor. Inspired by the philosophy of Kintsugi, the art of repairing cracks to create something more beautiful, Resolve intervenes at the communication moments that matter most.

We built two core phases:

Phase 1: The Mediator (Conflict Resolution)

During conflict, Resolve introduces a unique Cool-down Buffer—a required period of emotional labeling and countdown that helps partners decelerate out of the emotional storm.
Then, the AI Copilot transforms blaming or aggressive statements (e.g., “You always do this!”) into NVC-aligned sentences structured around Observation / Feeling / Need, ensuring messages carry needs and care rather than hurt and accusation.

Phase 2: The Gardener (Relationship Nurturing)

To prevent emotional overdraft, Resolve includes a Daily Connection ritual. Each day, partners receive a psychologically grounded prompt—ranging from memories to values. Through a Blind Reveal mechanism, both answers remain hidden until each partner submits, encouraging curiosity and establishing a pattern of high-quality daily interaction.

DSA Tutor AI is an interactive learning assistant that helps students understand Data Structures and Algorithms concepts and solve coding problems step by step using Gemini 3 Pro. The app runs entirely in AI Studio and provides a focused space to ask doubts, generate explanations, and practice problems in a conversational way.

Core features
Concept tutoring: Users can ask theory questions (e.g., arrays, trees, DP) and get clear, structured explanations, examples, and intuition tailored to their level.

Guided problem solving: For a given DSA problem, the app walks through approach, edge cases, time–space complexity, and then helps refine solutions or debug code.

Multiple learning modes: The app can act as an explainer, interviewer (mock interview Q&A), or code reviewer, so learners can switch between understanding, practice, and feedback.

Context-aware chat: The conversation keeps track of earlier questions so the tutor can build on previous explanations instead of starting from scratch each time.

How it is built with Gemini 3
The app uses Gemini 3 Pro in AI Studio with a custom system prompt that defines the tutor’s role, teaching style, and response structure for DSA topics. It leverages the app UI to accept natural language questions, pass them to Gemini 3 Pro, and render the model’s responses as formatted, readable explanations and code snippets.

Value for users

The Problem:Emergency rooms are overcrowded. Doctors waste hours manually reviewing paperwork, leading to burnout and delayed care for critical patients. Traditional hospital systems are passive data stores that cannot ""see"" or ""think.""

The Solution: AIHealth Navigator is an intelligent clinical copilot. Patients simply upload a photo of a prescription or lab report and describe their symptoms. The app uses Gemini 3 Pro’s multimodal vision capabilities to extract structured medical data (medications, lab values) and its reasoning engine to correlate these with reported symptoms.

How It Uses Gemini:

Multimodal Triage: We feed text, images, and OCR data into Gemini to calculate a clinical ""Urgency Score"" (1-5).

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning :The AI provides a transparent medical rationale for its decision, helping doctors trust the output.

Doctor Dashboard: Critical cases are auto-prioritized. The system drafts clinical summaries and differential diagnoses, allowing doctors to focus on treatment rather than triage.

Impact: By automating the initial clinical assessment, AIHealth Navigator ensures high-risk patients are seen first, democratizes access to expert-level triage in rural areas, and streamlines hospital workflows end-to-end.",Gemini,"triage, gemini, data, clinical, aihealth, navigator, hospital, multimodal, symptoms, medical",,,https://youtu.be/AqyIsOMw5CQ,False,False,True,1459.0,https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gemini-3/writeups/new-writeup-1765030133689
288,Justice friend - Indian Consumer Complaint generator,"AI tool that helps Indian consumers create ready-to-file consumer court complaints with guided steps, low cost, and no lawyer needed.",,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 8, 2025","We built an AI-powered tool that helps Indian consumers create ready to file  consumer court complaints in a simple, affordable, and guided way, without needing to hire a lawyer.

In India, millions of consumers face unfair treatment every year. These include defective products, denied refunds, poor service, hidden charges, delayed deliveries, and unresponsive companies. While consumer courts exist to protect citizens, most people never use them. The reason is not lack of merit but lack of access. Legal language is intimidating, processes feel complex, lawyers are expensive for small claims, and people do not know where to start.

Our project directly addresses this gap.

Today, an average Indian consumer experiences three major barriers when seeking justice:

1) Fear and confusion
People do not understand legal terms or court processes. Even when they are right, they worry about doing something wrong.

2) High cost relative to loss
For a loss of five thousand or ten thousand rupees, paying an advocate does not feel worth it. So consumers give up.

3) Complex procedures
Consumer courts require structured complaints, proper formatting, jurisdiction selection, annexures, and timelines. For first time users, this is overwhelming.

As a result, many valid cases never get filed. This weakens consumer protection and allows unfair practices to continue.

Our tool acts like a calm, intelligent assistant that guides a consumer step by step from frustration to action.

Instead of asking users to understand the law, the system asks simple questions in everyday language, such as what went wrong, when it happened, how much money was involved, and whether any proof exists.

Behind the scenes, AI organizes this information into a legally acceptable structure used by Indian consumer courts.

At the end, the user receives a complete consumer court complaint document, ready to be filed online through the government e Daakhil portal or submitted physically.

Built for environments where clarity, empathy, and personalization are essential, Empathos enhances how individuals communicate with technology—and with each other—by adapting its responses, tone, and interaction style to the emotional and contextual needs of the user. In a world increasingly shaped by AI systems, Empathos stands apart as an engine not only of intelligence but of understanding.

At its core, Empathos Adaptive AI leverages a multi-layer emotional inference model that analyzes text, voice, and interaction patterns to derive a real-time “emotional signature.” This signature, a combination of sentiment, intent, intensity, and behavioral context, allows the system to modify its language, pacing, guidance, and support strategies dynamically. Rather than relying solely on pre-built sentiment analysis, Empathos incorporates a hybrid architecture combining transformer-based natural language processing with a lightweight, rule-augmented emotional state graph. This gives the system the flexibility of neural networks while maintaining precision, transparency, and controllability—crucial for ensuring emotionally safe interactions.

Empathos was developed during this hackathon with a single question in mind: How can AI become more human-attuned without compromising responsibility, safety, or user autonomy? The project grew from the observation that traditional digital communication tools—chatbots, support agents, recommendation engines—often fail not because their data is inaccurate but because their tone or delivery doesn’t match the user’s emotional state. People react not only to what technology says but how it says it. Empathos Adaptive AI aims to close that gap through emotional intelligence, personalization, and adaptive conversational design.

302,Intervify – Smart AI Interview Assistant,Intervify – Smart AI Interview Assistant,,Overall Track,"Hackathon Writeup · Dec 6, 2025","Intervify AI is a Gemini 3 Pro powered interview-preparation assistant designed to help candidates practice and improve their technical and behavioral interview skills. The system provides a complete, personalized mock interview experience by analyzing job descriptions, generating relevant interview questions, and evaluating candidate answers with structured feedback.

Traditional interview preparation is stressful and unstructured. Candidates often struggle to understand what a job requires, what questions to expect, and how well they are performing. Intervify AI solves this problem by using Gemini 3 Pro’s advanced reasoning capabilities to deliver an intelligent, adaptive interview coaching experience.

KEY FEATURES

Job Description Analyzer
Users paste any job description, and Gemini 3 Pro automatically extracts the role summary, required skills, responsibilities, seniority level, and key interview topics. This gives candidates immediate clarity about what the role demands.

Dynamic Interview Question Generator
Using both the job description and the candidate’s background, the system generates a set of highly relevant technical, behavioral, system-design, and coding interview questions. Each question includes difficulty level and an ideal answer outline.

AI-Powered Answer Evaluation
Candidates can write or speak their answers. Gemini 3 Pro evaluates the response and provides a score, strengths, weaknesses, actionable improvement suggestions, and a short summary verdict. This offers instant, high-quality feedback similar to a real interviewer.

WHY GEMINI 3 PRO?

Gemini 3 Pro provides strong reasoning power, multimodal capabilities, and structured output generation. These strengths allow the system to:

deeply understand job descriptions

generate context-aware interview questions

evaluate complex, open-ended answers

return clean JSON for UI and application integration

The user simply drags a paper scan or PDF into the app. Gemini 3 Pro’s multimodal vision reads the document, detects the document language, and builds a structured schema of fields, constraints and sections. FormAlly then drives a one-question-at-a-time flow: a floating prompt card asks the next question, while a smart todo bar shows current, next and completed fields so the user never gets lost.

The assistant speaks and listens. Users can answer with their voice or keyboard; screen-reader-friendly messages stay short and clear; and browser text-to-speech can read out each question. Signature fields open a canvas where a helper can sign with a mouse or pen. FormAlly links that signature to the signer’s full name and automatically stamps today’s date for the final PDF.

Under the hood, three Gemini calls power the app: one to extract the form schema from the PDF, one to manage conversational state and validation across turns, and one to generate a structured summary plus machine-readable export. No backend or auth is required; everything runs through AI Studio.

As a business owner, I found myself in a position common to many entrepreneurs: I had no financial officer, I hated to manual accounting, and I simply did not have the time to manage complex spreadsheets. Consequently, tax reporting periods became a nightmare of disorganized records and anxiety.

I decided to build a software solution that would solve this problem instantaneously, an AI that acts as a Financial Officer at some degree.

However, upon researching the landscape, I realized this was not just my problem. It is a systemic crisis affecting the backbone of Indonesia's economy.

The barrier to entry for proper financial management in Indonesia is dangerously high, creating a gap that threatens the survival of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).

The Financial Literacy Gap
Approximately 34.57% of Indonesia's population lacks adequate financial literacy. More critically, data from the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs reveals that 77.5% of MSME operators do not maintain regular bookkeeping. They are flying blind.

The Talent Shortage
Hiring help is often impossible. Indonesia faces a severe shortage of accounting professionals, requiring over 200,000 certified accountants to meet demand, yet currently possessing only around 10,000. This massive supply-demand gap leaves small businesses unable to afford professional financial guidance.

The Economic Consequence
The impact of this gap is devastating:

Numeriya was built to dismantle these barriers.

Numeriya is an autonomous AI accounting platform designed for the ""Non-Commercial Version"" hackathon track. It is not just a chatbot; it is a full-stack financial agent.

Team: Zulfikar

RuralMed AI is a clinical decision support system that addresses medical specialist shortages in rural and underserved areas. General practitioners in remote locations frequently operate without timely access to radiologists or dermatologists, which can result in diagnostic delays or preventable patient transfers.

The application uses Gemini 3 Pro's multimodal capabilities to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT/MRI scans, dermatological photographs, retinal images) in combination with structured patient information including symptoms, vital signs, and medical history.

The system performs clinical reasoning by validating image quality, identifying visual abnormalities, and correlating findings with patient data. It generates structured assessments that include triage recommendations, differential diagnoses with supporting rationale, visual annotations of abnormalities, and clinical guidance for the attending physician.

The application was developed using Google AI Studio to demonstrate how multimodal AI models can improve diagnostic access in resource-limited healthcare settings.

🎥 Video Demo: https://youtu.be/fPEp7LDXIZo 
🚀 Try the App: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/11InjgGwxNbztb5dk-Ge0r8xK7x_EGWGb?fullscreenApplet=true

Rural healthcare facilities often lack specialist availability. Patients presenting with abnormal chest radiographs or concerning dermatological findings may face weeks-long delays for specialist consultation. Local physicians, typically general practitioners, require immediate diagnostic support to make critical decisions about patient transfers, emergency interventions, or local treatment protocols. Delayed specialist access can adversely affect patient outcomes.

RuralMed AI functions as a multimodal diagnostic support tool that integrates visual and textual clinical data. The system replicates aspects of specialist clinical reasoning by analyzing complete patient presentations rather than isolated data points.

The Reality
In the terrifying moments of a theft or assault, time distorts. While police response times can average over 10 minutes, for a victim, those minutes feel like a lifetime. That gap between the distress call and the arrival of help is when people are most vulnerable. We asked: What if help could arrive in seconds?

The Vision
Guardian Eye is a web-based simulation of a rapid-response autonomous drone system. Think of it as an immediate ""first responder"" that provides eyes on the scene instantly. It doesn’t replace the police; it bridges the gap, offering immediate deterrence and a digital witness when it matters most.

How the Story Unfolds
Imagine you are walking alone at night and sense danger. You don't have time to dial a number or explain your location.

The Cry for Help: You simply speak a trigger word to your phone ""Help Help"" or ""Choor Choor"" (Thief Thief).

The Immediate Response: Your phone, running the Guardian Eye User App, instantly locks onto your GPS coordinates and broadcasts a silent distress signal.

The Launch: At the Command Center, the system wakes up. A simulated drone launches from the nearest station, its path automatically calculated to reach you fastest, avoiding obstacles along the way.

Eyes on the Ground: Within moments, the drone arrives. It doesn’t just record; it sees. Using Gemini AI, it identifies threats (people, weapons) and announces its presence, warning perpetrators that authorities have been notified.

Powered by Intelligence (The Tech Stack)
We built Guardian Eye to simulate a future where hardware and AI work together seamlessly.

The Brain (Gemini 2.5 Flash): The drone uses the user's camera to analyze the scene in real-time. It provides a tactical HUD that identifies objects and potential threats with high confidence. It also gives the drone a voice, generating dynamic warnings to de-escalate the situation.
